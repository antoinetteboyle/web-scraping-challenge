# Web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment, we build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. We created and cloned a new repository and made a folder web_scraping_challenge. Initial analysis was performed in a jupyter notebook mission_to_mars(./mission_mars.ipynb). The main code is within a sub folder called [Mission_to_Mars](./Mission_to_Mars) A number of modules were utilised including Splinter, Requests, BeautifulSoup, ChromeDriverManager, Flask and PyMongo.
